# urlRegex
A simple python script that opens links copied on the system's clipboard using regex
---
### Requirements
- python3 (duh)
- pyperclip
- python3-webbrowser

### Why?
I made this script to learn more about regex (I still haven't grasped it fully yet), and also as a useful utility to open the haystack of links that my friends send me.

### Beware ⚠️
Do not in any circumstances use this utility with the presence of unsafe links in your clipboard, as this script will open any link it finds in your clipboard using your default browser.
